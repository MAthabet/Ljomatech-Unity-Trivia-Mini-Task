Ljomatech Unity Trivia Mini-Task

 Unity version: Unity 6000.0.32f1

 For this project, my primary focus was on building a robust and scalable architecture by implementing the Observer design pattern through a central GameEvents manager.
Given more time, I would expand on this solid foundation by adding polished UI screen transitions and more animations to make the app feel alive.
Additionally, I would build out the results screen to provide players with more detailed statistics on their performance.

Features  in the Quiz Game:
- random questions and answers order
- Animations for correct and wrong answers
- loading questions from JSON file
- some SFX
- Hidden Restart Button on the bottom right
